# Aiddata Automated Coding

## Robocoder - Activity Codes

A ruby on rails service for automating the process of activity coding aid projects.
Approach builds a dictionary of all words off of all previously coded projects and associaties the activity codes with each word.
Breaks down new descriptions into words and suggests activty codes according to the dictionary.
Original code written by Adam Frey, modified by David Rust-Smith.

## Geocoder

A ruby on rails service for automatically geocoding IATI files. (Could easily be generalized to work on any description.)
Includes a gem we wrote for general coding and a rails app for mapping and handling IATI uploads via ui.
Original code written by David Rust-Smith, Berk, and Paulo at Ottawa Aid Hackathon.

## Tests

Some JavaScript code for testing the Robocoder while pulling projects from the AidData API.
