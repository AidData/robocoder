The study will assess the health sector requirements in five districts (Salim, Ntchisi, Mchinji, Nkhota Kota and Phalombe) and the feasibility of establishing a nursing and paramedical training school in Mzuzu. It will propose appropriate measures to strengthen the management of the health sector and the capacity of the Government to maintain health facilities and equipment. The study will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will identify major constraints in providing health care in the study area and evaluate the approaches adopted by the Government and donor agencies to reform the health sector of Malawi. It will also undertake a detailed analysis of the major problems of the health sector in the five districts; and define appropriate measures to strengthen the health care system. The second stage will consist of developing a scheme of project designs covering priority facilities and health programs. The third phase will develop detailed designs (working designs) and tender documents for projects implementation. The study will help to identify and prepare the most appropriate interventions for improving the health status of the population. The ADF/TAF grant was approved by the Board on 20 November 1997 and will finance 94 percent of the project cost and the Government of Malawi will contribute the remaining 6 per cent. The study will be implemented over a period of 24 months.</description><sector code="120" vocabulary = "DAC-3">HEALTH</sector><sector code="12000" vocabulary = "DAC">Health, combination of general, basic, and population policy/reproductive health purposes</sector><sector code="12110.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Health sector policy, planning and programmes</sector><sector code="12181.01" vocabulary = "ADT">All medical education/training activities</sector><participating-org role="Funding">African Development Fund (AFDF)</participating-org><participating-org role="undefined">Malawi</participating-org><recipient-country code="MW">Malawi</recipient-country><transaction ref="135654903" ><transaction-type code="C">Commitment</transaction-type><value currency="UA (AFDB)" value-date="1997-01-01">1349250.0038689743</value><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="135654905" ><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="135654906" ><transaction-type code="D">Disbursement</transaction-type><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="137591770" ><value currency="UA (AFDB)" value-date="1997-01-01">80955.00023213845</value><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction></iati-activity>

The program, which will be  complemented by project assistance under 6120248, will disburse a cash  grant of $30.5 million in four tranches in accordance with the  conditionality noted below and be used as a Government of Malawi (GOM)  budgetary resource for natural resource management (NRM)-related  activities.  No local currency will be generated.  NATURE&amp;apos;s four areas of conditionality, along with key GOM actions,  are as follows.  (1) The GOM will establish a unifying, comprehensive  policy and legislative framework governing NRM, principally by  approving the National Environmental Policy (NEP) and by revising NRM  and land use/tenure policies and legislation so they support the  development of co-management systems for NRM and supportive  partnerships between rural communities, government, NGOs, and the GOM.  Revisions to legislation will focus on resource tenure and empower  governments to delegate NRM responsibilities to rural communities.  (2) The GOM will strengthen its institutional capacity for NRM by  clarifying the role of the institution responsible for coordinating and  monitoring NRM, fully staffing the Department of Environmental Affairs  of the Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs (MOREA),  redefining all ministerial roles and responsibilities vis-a-vis NRM and  increasing community participation in NRM and the resolution of  resource-use conflicts, and improving compliance with legislation and  regulations governing forestry, fisheries, and wildlife.  (3) The GOM will implement results-driven NRM programs, including  multi-year work plans in the area of NRM and the environment.  The GOM  will notify USAID of approved programs, identify the implementor,  establish verifiable performance indicators for the programs, and  provide funding levels adequate to achieve those indicators.  (4) The GOM will achieve sustainable financing for private  initiatives in NRM and environmental protection, principally by forming  a working group of NGO, business, and GOM representatives to create a  legally incorporated private endowment trust fund.</description><other-identifier>6120247</other-identifier><sector code="410" vocabulary = "DAC-3">GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</sector><sector code="41010" vocabulary = "DAC">Environmental policy and administrative management</sector><sector code="31210.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Forestry policy and administrative management, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group</sector><sector code="41010.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Environmental policy, laws, regulations and economic instruments</sector><sector code="43040.04" vocabulary = "ADT">Land use planning and management</sector><sector code="15150.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Community participation and development</sector><sector code="51010.01" vocabulary = "ADT">General budget support, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in this group</sector><sector code="41010.03" vocabulary = "ADT">Institution capacity building, Environmental protection</sector><participating-org role="Funding">United States</participating-org><participating-org role="Extending">AID</participating-org><participating-org role="Implementing">    no value    </participating-org><recipient-country code="MW">Malawi</recipient-country><transaction ref="137244172" ><transaction-type code="C">Commitment</transaction-type><transaction-date iso-date="9999-01-01"/></transaction></iati-activity>

The program  will consist of a cash grant tied to Government of Malawi (GOM) policy  actions.  The grant will be used to support the Ministry of Education  and Culture&amp;apos;s budget. Local currency will not be generated.  Specific program objectives are to increase the financial resources  and internal efficiency of the education sector, improve the quality of  primary education, and increase girls&amp;apos; access to a gender-appropriate  curriculum.  To achieve these, the GOM agrees to:  (1) increase the  share of the budget devoted to education, particularly to primary  education; (2) build more primary schools, classrooms, and teachers&amp;apos;  houses; (3) train more teachers through efficient utilization of  teachers&amp;apos; colleges; (4) provide more learning materials at a lower cost  by privatizing procedures for procurement and distribution; (5) reduce  repetition in Standards 1-7; and (6) encourage girls&amp;apos; attainment levels  in primary school by waiving the fees for girls who do not repeat and  by introducing a gender-appropriate curriculum.  In addition, the GOM  pledges its best efforts to increase the percentage of girls enrolled  in secondary schools to at least one-third of the total enrollment.  Complementary TA will be provided under project 6120237.  PAAD/PP amendment of 9/28/94 authorizes three new tranches of $7  million each and extends the program until 9/98 in order to help the  GOM fulfill its new policy of free primary education (announcement of  which almost doubled primary enrollment rate).  The GOM agrees to: (1)  increase budgetary allocations to education, primary education, and  primary education learning materials, and increase cost-recovery at the  university level as a means to these ends; (2) improve educational  quality by implementing a community-based school system for standards  1-4 (with emphasis on isolated areas), increasing the number of primary  school teachers and their training, and increasing the supply of  primary learning materials and classrooms; (3) improve efficiency by  introducing policies to reduce repetition and late entry in all  standards and by improving the analytical and planning capacity of the  Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MOEST); and (4) improve  relevance for girls through gender-appropriate teacher training and  curricula, a scholarship program for secondary school girls, and the  introduction of classroom techniques to enhance girls&amp;apos; achievement.

Since the RFSP is unlikely to serve the lower echelon of poor households; IFAD is supporting the establishment of a &amp;quot;Mudzi Window&amp;quot; within the Malawi Rural Finance Company (MRFC) to provide financial services to IFAD&amp;apos;s target group, including credit and institutional support to promote savings and credit groups. It should be noted that IFAD had introduced a Pilot Credit Scheme for the rural poor (Malawi Mudzi Fund) under
its previous Smallholder Agricultural Credit Project. The Mudzi Fund is specifically directed at providing incremental funding for revolving credit for the poor. The central objective of IFAD&amp;apos;s support is to increase the family incomes and food security of the poor rural families who would otherwise be bypassed. The target group represents a potential catchment of not less than one million households. Over the six years of its projected life, the project will aim to reach a clientele of the order of 70 000 households, half of which would be headed by women. The IFAD components under the sub-project are: (i) a credit facility, via the &amp;quot;Mudzi Window&amp;quot;, to cater specifically for the needs of the resource-poor; (ii) institution-building, under which additional support is to be provided to MRFC
through financial incentives to handle the &amp;quot;Mudzi Window&amp;quot;, as
well as staff training and resources for MRFC&amp;apos;s Business Development Unit; (iii) rural group linkages, whereby support is to be provided through an NGO network or alternative arrangements to strengthen a wide range of existing groups in group dynamics, bookkeeping, management and credit access, and in the formation of new groups of resource-poor households; and (iv) the establishment of a pilot scheme for rural savings, set up to test and develop principles and procedures for promoting and supporting savings among sub-project participants.</description><other-identifier>I-338-MW</other-identifier><sector code="240" vocabulary = "DAC-3">BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES</sector><sector code="24030" vocabulary = "DAC">Formal sector financial intermediaries</sector><sector code="24030.03" vocabulary = "ADT">Credit lines</sector><sector code="24081.01" vocabulary = "ADT">All banking and financial services education/training activities</sector><sector code="31110.03" vocabulary = "ADT">Institution capacity building, Agriculture</sector><sector code="43040.03" vocabulary = "ADT">Rural development, planning and management</sector><sector code="42010.06" vocabulary = "ADT">WID financial services</sector><sector code="43040.05" vocabulary = "ADT">Rural infrastructure and services</sector><participating-org role="Funding">International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)</participating-org><participating-org role="Extending"> no value</participating-org><participating-org role="Implementing">    no value    </participating-org><participating-org role="undefined">Malawi</participating-org><recipient-country code="MW">Malawi</recipient-country><transaction ref="137265080" ><transaction-type code="C">Commitment</transaction-type><value currency="USD" value-date="1993-01-01">11980000</value><transaction-date iso-date="1993-01-01"/><flow-type code="10">ODA</flow-type></transaction><transaction ref="137581884" ><value currency="USD" value-date="1993-01-01">1240000</value><transaction-date iso-date="1993-01-01"/><flow-type code="10">ODA</flow-type></transaction></iati-activity>

This will be achieved through facilitating the access of participants to improved farming technology, credit and markets. The project will contribute to enhancing the smallholders&amp;apos; productivity through training, provision of improved seed and plants, small livestock raising and small scale irrigation (well-digging and diversion dykes). It will also rehabilitate rural infrastructure, namely access roads and drinking water supply. Low-cost and simple farm technology, which guarantee high return on investments, will be introduced to help the farmers.

The project will lead to improved and steady income for the poor farmers. The income of the beneficiaries (about 63,000 families) is expected to increase by 60 per cent at the end of the project. Women, who represent about 60 per cent of population of the project area and 70 per cent of the total farm labor, will benefit significantly from the project. Provision of water and road rehabilitation will ease their chores and facilitate the access of their products and other food surpluses to local trading centers.

The project will introduce environment-improving agricultural production methods, such as soil and water conservation schemes and will reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides.The loan was approved by the Board on 10 December 1997 and the ADF will finance 71 per cent of the project total cost. The Government will contribute 26. per cent while the beneficiaries will provide 3 per cent. The project will be implemented over a period of 5 years.</description><sector code="311" vocabulary = "DAC-3">Agriculture</sector><sector code="31120" vocabulary = "DAC">Agricultural development</sector><sector code="14030.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Water supply and sanitation, low-cost technologies</sector><sector code="31120.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural development, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group</sector><sector code="31120.04" vocabulary = "ADT">Feeder roads</sector><sector code="31120.05" vocabulary = "ADT">Agriculture infrastructure</sector><sector code="31130.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural land resources, activity unspecified  or does not fit elsewhere in group</sector><sector code="31140.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural water resources, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group</sector><sector code="31140.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Irrigation</sector><sector code="31150.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural inputs, activity unspecified or does not fit elsewhere in group</sector><sector code="31150.02" vocabulary = "ADT">Supply of seeds</sector><sector code="31191.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural services </sector><sector code="31191.03" vocabulary = "ADT">Agricultural financial services</sector><sector code="41005.01" vocabulary = "ADT">General environmental protection, activity unspecified (includes miscellaneous conservation and protection measures not mentioned below) or does not fit under any other applicable codes</sector><sector code="31181.01" vocabulary = "ADT">Formal education/training, Agriculture</sector><participating-org role="Funding">African Development Fund (AFDF)</participating-org><participating-org role="undefined">Beneficiaries</participating-org><participating-org role="undefined">Malawi</participating-org><recipient-country code="MW">Malawi</recipient-country><transaction ref="137473957" ><transaction-type code="C">Commitment</transaction-type><value currency="UA (AFDB)" value-date="1997-01-01">9525705.02731496</value><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="137473959" ><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="137473960" ><transaction-type code="D">Disbursement</transaction-type><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="137591774" ><value currency="UA (AFDB)" value-date="1997-01-01">400322.47614792467</value><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction><transaction ref="137591775" ><value currency="UA (AFDB)" value-date="1997-01-01">3469461.4599486804</value><transaction-date iso-date="1997-01-01"/></transaction></iati-activity>
